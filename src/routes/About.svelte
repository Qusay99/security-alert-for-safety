			<p>Security Alert For Safety is an open-source web application that was developed by business informatics students.</p>
			<p>
				The application should help people in dangerous situations by sending a message to a specific telegram group.
				The Group will be chosen automatically based on the location of the endangered person so that the message will be sent to the nearest city to the person.
				The victim could enter his name when starting the application in case he wants his name to be sent with the alarm message.
				Firstly, we created 4 telegram groups for the following cities in Germany. This could be modified by adding more groups to fit
				the Country and cities in which the web application will be used.

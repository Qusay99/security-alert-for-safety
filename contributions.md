### Unit-Changer-Module (Temperature, Distance, Weight)

I created a little deno module called "unit_changer" that can be used to change units from distances, temperatures and weights.
This module can be extended easily by other users, e.g. to include currencies, speeds/velocities. +

Currently I can't publish the module on deno. I followed every instruction on the webiste:

1. I published a release of the repo on github.
2. I created a Webhook according to the instructions.
3. I created the module on deno.

On the deno webiste the following error occurs:
